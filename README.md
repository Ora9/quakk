# Quakk !

Quakk is a node based live coding synthesizer

This project is currently under construction ! But might someday be a software i would use to make music, graphic visualisation and even light shows :)

# Roadmap

An informative roadmap to give an overview of what i'm planning to do along with a idea of when it is planned, and also what i already done !

## To Alpha

A first release of Quakk, a minimal but working software

- [ ] A rust library to build node graphs
  - [x] Data flowing !
  - [ ] A few nodes for for numeric and textual manipulation
  - [ ] Good error management
- [ ] A simple CLI tool for experimentation
  - [ ] Input/Output
  - [ ] Files open/save as

## Future 

In the future, a few goals given as direction for the project

- [ ] Quakk rust lib published on crates.io with a stable API for embedded node based computation
- [ ] A solid node library for easy and powerful numeric and textual manipulation
- [ ] Other `quakk_*` crates for other data types like audio and video !
- [ ] A software with a GUI to live code on, with a visual node workspace and ergonomic tools
