# Quack !

Quack is a node based live coding environnement

This project is at its mere beginning! But might someday be a software i would use to make music, graphic visualisation and even light shows :)

# Roadmap

Following is a informative roadmap to give an idea of what i would like to work on :
- [ ] A rust library to build node graph, with a few nodes for numeric and textual manipulation
- [ ] A few more nodes to work with sound !
- [ ] A software with a GUI to live code, with a visual node workspace and tools
